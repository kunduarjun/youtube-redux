## YouTube-Redux Firefox Browser Extension

This is a simple Firefox Browser Extension that allows for users to clean up their YouTube interface to allow for more focused watching. This is done by removing the comments and recommended videos (right-side panel) from the video player view. Advertisements and sponsorships are also removed from the right-side panel. 

Future considerations: Cleaning up the YouTube landing page and the YouTube shorts player. Also, limiting the amount of comments and recommened videos shown on the video player view instead of complete removal. It would also be great to create a separate extension with the same functionality for other browsers (i.e., Google Chrome).
