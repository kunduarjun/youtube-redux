## YouTube-Redux Firefox Browser Extension

This is a simple Firefox Browser Extension that allows for users to clean up their YouTube interface to allow for more focused watching. This is done by removing the comments and recommended videos (right-side panel) shown to users when on the video player. Advertisements and Sponserships are also removed from the right-side panel. 

Future considerations: Cleaning up the YouTube landing page and the YouTube shorts player.
